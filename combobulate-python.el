  "Smarter indentation handling.

Greatly improves indentation handling when you indent
regions. Combobulate will automatically indent the region and
preserve the existing indentation. You can then cycle through
indentation levels to pick the right one.

If `combobulate-python-indent-blocks-dwim' is non-nil, then
Combobulate will automatically pick the code block immediately
ahead of point. You can use this to cycle through the indentation
of blocks of code: functions, for statements, etc.

This works by remapping `indent-for-tab-command' to
`combobulate-python-indent-for-tab-command'."
